# Instrument configuration for dutctl.
# WARNING: Changing these values has real electrical effects on connected DUTs,
# including potential death; check your config with no DUT unconnected first!

# If the remaining config doesn't hash to `safety_hash`, `dutctl` rejects it as
# a safety measure. You can bypass this with `0xd0a515a1` at your own risk.
safety_hash: 0xbadcab1e    # Check config carefully, then replace this hash.
