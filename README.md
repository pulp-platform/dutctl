# DUTCTL: A Flexible Open-Source Framework for Rapid Bring-Up, Characterization, and Remote Operation of Custom-Silicon RISC-V SoCs

**DUTCTL** is part of the [PULP (Parallel Ultra-Low-Power) platform](https://pulp-platform.org/).

It is an opensource framework automating the rapid, ATE-less bring-up and characterization of RISC-V-based SoCs by controlling and coordinating the necessary external devices.
DUTCTL provides the following features:

- It configures and controls any number of network-attached supplies, clock sources, and reset generators described in a customizable configuration.
- It coordinates a full reset-and-power cycle, ensuring statelessness and reproducibility, and provides a fully scriptable GDB debugging session.
- It monitors and stores the SoCâ€™s serial output; through control sequences, the SoC can communicate internal measurements (e.g. computed results, cycle counts) or trigger external measurements (e.g. supply power) with precise timing.
- Through iterated sessions with different parameters and debugging payloads, it enables the design of full test flows and characterization sweeps.
- It enables easy shared and remote access to limited engineering samples for time-efficient testing and software exploration.
